# Amaretti

Amaretti is a light-weight, cross-resource, multi-user task orchestration service written in nodejs. Amaretti is a meta processing managment system; it provides cross-resource orchestration relying on the individual resources batch scheduling systems. It manages data and computation execution across multiple architectures (e.g., clouds and high-performance computing). Its purpose is to reduce the users' management burden, facilitate data-intensive research and development and accelerate discovery.
